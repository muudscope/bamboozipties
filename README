Bamboo-zipties (#bzt) is a scaffolding system for Django.

It sets up a UI with basic CRUD operations for your objects, similar to what ruby on rails'
scaffolding system.  One big difference though.
The client code is all jquery/javascript, and the interaction with the server is through JSON.

Currently there's a single simple model in the 'blog' application.  The scaffolding is all in
place for this model.  At some point there will be a script to analyze your models and generate 
scaffolding for them.

There (will be) unit tests against all the JSON methods.

This provides a clean line of encapsulation between the view/client and the business logic.  Anything that can be done by the user happens
through JSON, and (will) has unit tests.

The project is named after a common system of construction scaffolding in SE Asia.  It is remarkably effective for how simple it is.
