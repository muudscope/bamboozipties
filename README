Bamboo-zipties is a scaffolding system for Django.

It sets up a UI with basic CRUD operations.
The client code is all jquery/javascript, and the interaction with the server is through JSON.

There (WILL BE) unit tests against all the JSON methods.

This provides a clean line of encapsulation between the view/client and the business logic.  Anything that can be done by the user happens
through JSON, and has unit tests.


The project is named after a common system of construction scaffolding in SE Asia.  It is remarkably effective for how simple it is.
